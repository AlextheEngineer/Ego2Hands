Ego2Hands is a large-scale dataset for the task of two-hand segmentation/detection in unconstrained environments. It provides images of the right hands only with backgrounds removed in a green screen setting, hand energy annotation is also available, allowing compositing-based data generation for unlimited training data with segmentation and detection ground truth. This dataset is introduced by our paper [Ego2Hands: A Dataset for Egocentric Two-hand Segmentation and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07252).
